# RFIndex Data

This is the open data repository behind [rfindex.com](https://rfindex.com) — a reference guide for amateur radio and Meshtastic equipment. All of the device specs, band definitions, and product listings on the site are stored here as JSON files.

Contributions are welcome. Whether you want to add a missing radio, update specs on a Meshtastic device, or fix a typo, this repo is the place to do it.

## Important disclaimers

- **This is just the data.** The rfindex.com website itself is a separate, closed-source project. This repo contains only the structured data that powers it.
- **Referral links.** Purchase URLs in this dataset may contain affiliate/referral links. Revenue from these links supports the ongoing development of rfindex.com. By contributing data that includes purchase URLs, you acknowledge that these links may be modified to include referral tracking.
- **No guarantee of publication.** Contributions are reviewed before being merged. Data that appears in this repo will be displayed on rfindex.com at the maintainer's discretion.

### Adding or editing data by hand

Each entry is a single JSON file. To contribute, you can edit files directly or create new ones.

**Adding a new ham radio:** Create a JSON file in `data/radios/` using this structure:

```json
